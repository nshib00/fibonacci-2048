## How to play? 

- Click on arrows (←, →, ↑, ↓) for moving to merge cells with same values.
Merging two cells will increase your score and the value of the merged cell.
- Merge cells until the field is filled with cells that cannot be merged with neighboring cells.

Try to get as high a score as you can :)
